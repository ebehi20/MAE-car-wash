## Additional Information

This is a minimal prototype build with Vite and React. For the full application with all features, we'll need to implement:

1. The sidebar navigation
2. Dashboard statistics cards
3. Performance charts 
4. Activity feed
5. Backend API integration

The complete design can be found in the main project directory.
